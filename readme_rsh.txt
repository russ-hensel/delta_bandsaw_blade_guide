guide_v1

    print at 30% to get ideas on dim and printing
	orientation 
	printed in operating position with support
	took something over an hour
	  
	  
	  result:
		stem just fit with just a bit of filing
		cool block did not fit even with filing ( should file )
		fitted in 1/4 inch bolts with tap, did not try to fit nuts
			check nut dim against knob tutorial
			
		did fit reduced block of epay and saw works reasonably well with this
		seems sturdy enough id not too much so.
		
		
	Next:
		check on nut size
		have some un constrained sketch fix
		resize the cool block and test print first
